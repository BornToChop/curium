Building a Public TestNet Validator + Sentry
============================================

1.  Refer to previous documents for initializing the server, dev environments, 
    and building the Bluzelle Curium applications. Open incoming TCP ports 
    26656 (P2P), 26657 (RPC), and 1317 (RESTful). If you are only running a
    validator, open all ports. If you are running both, follow these
    directives:
    
    - Sentry: P2P, RPC, RESTful
    - Validator: Only P2P
